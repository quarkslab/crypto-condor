	abstract = {We demonstrate how the framework that is used for creating efficient number-theoretic ID and signature schemes can be transferred into the setting of lattices. This results in constructions of the most efficient to-date identification and signature schemes with security based on the worst-case hardness of problems in ideal lattices. In particular, our ID scheme has communication complexity of around 65, 000 bits and the length of the signatures produced by our signature scheme is about 50, 000 bits. All prior lattice-based identification schemes required on the order of millions of bits to be transferred, while all previous lattice-based signature schemes were either stateful, too inefficient, or produced signatures whose lengths were also on the order of millions of bits. The security of our identification scheme is based on the hardness of finding the approximate shortest vector to within a factor of O˜(n2) in the standard model, while the security of the signature scheme is based on the same assumption in the random oracle model. Our protocols are very eﬃcient, with all operations requiring O˜(n) time.},

Our resulting signature scheme is secure, in the random oracle model, based on the worst-case hardness of the O˜(n1.5)-SIVP problem in general lattices. The secret key, public key, and the signature size of our scheme are smaller than in all previous instantiations of the hash-and-sign signature, and our signing algorithm is also quite simple, requiring just a few matrix-vector multiplications and rejection samplings. We then also show that by slightly changing the parameters, one can get even more efficient signatures that are based on the hardness of the Learning With Errors problem. Our construction naturally transfers to the ring setting, where the size of the public and secret keys can be significantly shrunk, which results in the most practical to-date provably secure signature scheme based on lattices.},

Further algorithmic advances on these problems may lead to the unpleasant situation that a large number of schemes have to be replaced with alternatives. In this work we present such an alternative – a signature scheme whose security is derived from the hardness of lattice problems. It is based on recent theoretical advances in lattice-based cryptography and is highly optimized for practicability and use in embedded systems. The public and secret keys are roughly 12000 and 2000 bits long, while the signature size is approximately 9000 bits for a security level of around 100 bits. The implementation results on reconfigurable hardware (Spartan/Virtex 6) are very promising and show that the scheme is scalable, has low area consumption, and even outperforms some classical schemes.},

The novel scheme is obtained as a result of a modification of the rejection sampling algorithm that is at the heart of Lyubashevsky’s signature scheme (Eurocrypt, 2012) and several other lattice primitives. Our new rejection sampling algorithm which samples from a bimodal Gaussian distribution, combined with a modified scheme instantiation, ends up reducing the standard deviation of the resulting signatures by a factor that is asymptotically square root in the security parameter. The implementations of our signature scheme for security levels of 128, 160, and 192 bits compare very favorably to existing schemes such as RSA and ECDSA in terms of efficiency. In addition, the new scheme has shorter signature and public key sizes than all previously proposed lattice signature schemes.},

Several works have been devoted to its efficient implementation on various platforms, from desktop CPUs to microcontrollers and FPGAs, and more recent papers have also considered its security against certain types of physical attacks, notably fault injection and cache attacks. We turn to more traditional side-channel analysis, and describe several attacks that can yield a full key recovery. We first identify a serious source of leakage in the rejection sampling algorithm used during signature generation. Existing implementations of that rejection sampling step, which is essential for security, actually leak the “relative norm” of the secret key. We show how an extension of an algorithm due to Howgrave-Graham and Szydlo can be used to recover the key from that relative norm, at least when the absolute norm is easy to factor (which happens for a significant fraction of secret keys). We describe how this leakage can be exploited in practice both on an embedded device (an 8-bit AVR microcontroller) using electromagnetic analysis (EMA), and a desktop computer (recent Intel CPU running Linux) using branch tracing. The latter attack has been mounted against the open source VPN software strongSwan.},

	abstract = {Ed25519 is an instance of the Elliptic Curve based signature scheme EdDSA that was recently introduced to solve an inconvenience of the more established ECDSA. Namely, both schemes require the generation of a random value (scalar of the ephemeral key pair) during the signature generation process and the secrecy of this random value is critical for security: knowledge of one such a random value, or partial knowledge of a series of them, allows reconstructing the signer’s private key. In ECDSA it is not specified how to generate this random value and hence implementations critically rely on the quality of random number generators and are challenging to implement securely. EdDSA removes this dependence by deriving the secret deterministically from the message and a long-term auxiliary key using a cryptographic hash function. The feature of determinism has received wide support as enabling secure implementations and in particular deployment of Ed25519 is spectacular. Today Ed25519 is used in numerous security protocols, networks and both software and hardware security products e.g. OpenSSH, Tor, GnuPG etc.},

We show how two deterministic lattice-based signature schemes, Dilithium and qTESLA, are vulnerable to such attacks. In particular, we demonstrate that single random faults can result in a nonce-reuse scenario which allows key recovery. We also expand this to fault-induced partial nonce-reuse attacks, which do not corrupt the validity of the computed signatures and thus are harder to detect. Using linear algebra and lattice-basis reduction techniques, an attacker can extract one of the secret key elements after a successful fault injection. Some other parts of the key cannot be recovered, but we show that a tweaked signature algorithm can still successfully sign any message. We provide experimental verification of our attacks by performing clock glitching on an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller. In particular, we show that up to 65.2 of the execution time of Dilithium is vulnerable to an unprofiled attack, where a random fault is injected anywhere during the signing procedure and still leads to a successful key-recovery.},

  abstract={Side-channel security has become a significant concern in the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization process. The lattice-based CRYSTALS-Dilithium (abbr. Dilithium) becomes the primary signature standard algorithm recommended by NIST for most use cases in July 2022 due to its excellent performance in security and efficiency. Compared to Dilithium’s rich theoretical security analysis results, the side-channel security of its physical implementations needs to be further explored. In 2021, Liu et al. proposed a two-stage randomness leakage attack against Dilithium, in which only one randomness bit with a probability  $> 0.5$  per signature is enough to recover the private key. However, they only carried out proof-of-concept experiments on “research-oriented” reference implementation of polynomial addition. Whether this method applies to complete real-world implementations of Dilithium is unknown. In this paper, we put this randomness leakage attack into real-world and recover the private key of unprotected and masked Dilithium on Arm Cortex-M4 processor using non-profiled power analysis attacks. Since randomness is introduced in the signing process, it is challenging to recover the randomness bit of Dilithium with high success rate in only one trace. Inspired by Liu et al., we propose a new non-profiled attack called Public Template Attack (PTA), a template-attack-like method that builds templates using public information. With PTA, we recover the randomness bit of unprotected and masked Dilithium with a success rate of 95% and 62% in one power trace, respectively. To demonstrate practicality, we perform practical power analysis attacks against different security levels of round 3 unprotected and masked Dilithium on STM32F405 microprocessor. Using 10,000 traces, the private key of unprotected Dilithium2 is recovered in 0.5 hours with an ordinary PC desktop. Our attack is 240 times faster than the state-of-the-art non-profiled attack. Moreover, the private key of masked Dilithium2 is recovered using 680,000 traces in 38 hours. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully attack masked Dilithium using non-profiled attacks.},
