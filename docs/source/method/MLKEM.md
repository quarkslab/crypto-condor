# ML-KEM

:::{attention} Work in progress
We are currently updating the CRYSTALS-Kyber guide to ML-KEM.
:::

[Kyber](https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/index.shtml) is "an IND-CCA2-secure key
encapsulation mechanism (KEM), whose security is based on the hardness of
solving the learning-with-errors (LWE) problem over module lattices".

In the following guide:

- {math}`R` denotes the ring {math}`\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^n + 1)`.
- {math}`R_q` denotes the ring {math}`\mathbb{Z}_q[X]/(X^n + 1)`.
- {math}`n = 2^{n'-1}` such that {math}`X^n + 1` is the {math}`2^{n'}`-th cyclotomic polynomial.
- {math}`\mathcal{B}^K` (resp. {math}`\mathcal{B}^*`) is the set of bytes arrays
  of length {math}`k` (resp. of arbitrary length).

## Parameters

"Parameters", "Description"
"{math}`n`", "{math}`n = 2^{n' - 1}` such that {math}`X^n + 1` is the {math}`2^{n'}`-th cyclotomic polynomial."
"{math}`k`", "The lattice dimension is set to a multiple of {math}`n`, with {math}`k` being the multiplier. Kyber uses this parametrize the security/efficiency of the algorithm."
"{math}`q`", "A small prime satisfying {math}`n | (q-1)` while retaining CCA security. Using a small prime allows the use of fast multiplication based on {abbr}`NTT (number-theoretic transform)`."
"{math}`\eta_1`, {math}`\eta_2`", "Kyber uses a centered binomial distribution noted {math}`B_{\eta}`, with {math}`\eta = 2` or {math}`\eta = 3`, for sampling noise. {math}`\eta_1` defines the noise used in Kyber.CPAPKE.KeyGen and some of the noise in Kyber.CPAPKE.Enc, while {math}`\eta_2` defines the noise of Kyber.CPAPKE.Enc only."
"{math}`d_u`, {math}`d_v`", "Control the ciphertext compression."

There is a variant of Kyber that uses the existing hardware support for
symmetric primitives.  Called Kyber-90s, it uses AES-256-CTR and SHA2.

The authors offer two recommendations:

> - Using Kyber in a *hybrid-mode*, combined with an established primitive such as
>   elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman.
> - Using the Kyber768 parameter set, which is estimated to achieve more than 128
>   bits of security.

## Implementations

The reference implementation can be found on GitHub:
[pq-crystals/kyber](https://github.com/pq-crystals/kyber). It includes an
optimized version with AVX2.

The [repository and the NIST submission
packages](https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/resources.shtml) include an AVX2
optimized implementation.

Kyber is integrated in Open Quantum Safe's
[liboqs](https://openquantumsafe.org/liboqs/algorithms/kem/kyber) and
[PQClean](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean). The latter includes an aarch64
version.

Other third-party implementations are referenced in the
[Software](https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/software.shtml) page, such as:

- An integration in Cloudflare's [CIRCL](https://github.com/cloudflare/circl)
{cite}`sullivan_securing_2020`.
- An integration in Amazon's [AWS Key Management
Service](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) {cite}`weibel_round_2020`.
- An integration in the [Botan C++](https://github.com/randombit/botan) library.
- An integration in [Bouncy Castle](https://downloads.bouncycastle.org/betas/).
- And implementations in a variety of programming languages such as
[Rust](https://github.com/Argyle-Software/kyber),
[Python](https://github.com/asdfjkl/pyky),
[Java](https://github.com/fisherstevenk/kyberJCE), and
[Go](https://git.schwanenlied.me/yawning/kyber).

## Benchmarks

Benchmarks performed on an Intel i7-8565u using the [provided
programs](https://github.com/pq-crystals/kyber#benchmarking-programs).

There are also benchmarks provided by the authors in [Kyber's
homepage](https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/index.shtml) as well as [benchmarks from
the SUPERCOP benchmarking
framework](http://bench.cr.yp.to/results-kem.html#amd64-kizomba).

## Attacks

More recently, there have been a number of side-channels attacks:

{cite}`ji_side-channel_2023`.
- A Side-Channel Secret Key Recovery Attack on CRYSTALS-Kyber Using k Chosen
Ciphertexts, {cite}`el_hajji_side-channel_2023`, {cite}`yang_chosen_2023`.
- Secret Key Recovery Attacks on Masked and Shuffled Implementations of
CRYSTALS-Kyber and Saber, {cite}`cryptoeprint:2022/1692`.
- Chosen-Ciphertext Clustering Attack on CRYSTALS-Kyber Using the Side-Channel
