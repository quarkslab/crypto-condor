:::{attention} Work in progress
We are currently updating the CRYSTALS-Dilithium guide to ML-DSA.

[Dilithium](https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/index.shtml) is "a digital
signature scheme that is strongly secure under chosen message attacks based on
the hardness of lattice problems over module lattices"
{cite}`schwabe_dilithium_nodate`.

The latest version of the specification at the time of writing can be found
[here](https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/data/dilithium-specification-round3-20210208.pdf).

> A high-level overview of the scheme is available in [this
> presentation](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Presentations/Crystals-Dilithium/images-media/CRYSTALS-Dilithium-April2018.pdf).
> NIST submission packages and the different versions of the paper are available

Dilithium is based on the "Fiat-Shamir with Aborts" approach described in
{cite}`hutchison_fiat-shamir_2009`, {cite}`hutchison_lattice_2012`, and
resembles the schemes {cite}`hutchison_practical_2012` and
{cite}`hutchison_improved_2014`.

Unlike the schemes presented in {cite}`canetti_lattice_2013` and
{cite}`sarkar_efficient_2014` that sample randomness from a discrete Gaussian
distribution, Dilithium uses uniform sampling. This was proposed in
{cite}`hutchison_fiat-shamir_2009` and {cite}`hutchison_practical_2012`, and has
the advantage of avoiding the problem of safely implementing Gaussian sampling,
which is hard to protect against side-channel attacks such as
{cite}`gierlichs_flush_2016`, {cite}`espitau_side-channel_2017`, and
{cite}`pessl_bliss-b_2017`.

While Dilithium is a random scheme, it offers a deterministic variant which the
authors recommend by the default as long as side-channel attacks that exploit
determinism cannot be mounted. For examples, see {cite}`smart_breaking_2018` and
{cite}`poddebniak_attacking_2018`.

The operations used for signing and verification are mostly expansion of an XOF,
in this case SHAKE128 and SHAKE256. The other set of heavily used operations are
multiplications in {math}`R_q`, which is why the scheme uses the same ring for
all parameter sets. As with Kyber, polynomial mulitiplication is implemented
with the [Number Theoretic
Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform_over_a_ring#Number-theoretic_transform).

The authors offer two recommendations:

> - Use Dilithium in a so-called hybrid mode in combination with an established
>   "pre-quantum" signature scheme.
> - We recommend using the Dilithium3 parameter set, which—according to a very
>   conservative analysis—achieves more than 128 bits of security against all known
>   classical and quantum attacks.

This scheme uses the ring {math}`R_q = \mathbb{Z}_q[X] / (X^n + 1)`, with
{math}`q = 2^{23} - 2^{13} + 1` and {math}`n = 256`.
