Harness API
===========

Inspired by fuzzing harnesses, |cc| can test implementation wrapped in a shared library.

    :alt: The diagram showing how crypto-condor, the shared library, and the implementation to test interact with each other. The shared library is loaded into crypto-condor using ``dlopen``, and is used to interact with the implementation, passing the test vectors to use and returning the results.

How to use
----------

The idea is to create a shared library that interacts with the primitives to test. It
will expose some functions, whose name starts with ``CC``, that wrap a given operation
of the implementation. Their function signature is established by |cc| so that it can
run the functions with the corresponding test vectors.

How it works
------------

Internally, the library is first loaded with ``dlopen`` and its symbols examined with
`lief <https://lief.re/>`_. The functions whose name starts with ``CC`` are examined to
see if the full name matches a known pattern for the primitives that support this mode.
Those that match are passed to the corresponding modules, which run them with the test
vectors chosen by the function name.
