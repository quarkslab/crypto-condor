Test vectors
============

Test vectors come from various sources.

* NIST test vectors, as provided in the `Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program <https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-algorithm-validation-program>`__.
* `Project Wycheproof <https://github.com/google/wycheproof>`__ [1]_ test vectors.
* AES-CTR test vectors taken from `RFC3686 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3686.html#section-6>`__.
